abstract: Lancaster and Humphreys (1) attempted to identify drivers of plant thermal tolerances by analyzing a newly compiled database of heat and cold tolerances. Lancaster and Humphreys conclude that variation in thermal tolerances is attributable to a combination of phylogeny, geography, and local environment, and that the observed patterns “are not an artifact of measurement method” used to estimate tolerances. We applaud Lancaster and Humphreys’ efforts to compile and analyze global patterns in thermal tolerances, but we feel that it is necessary to highlight additional sources of methodological variation that could alter the authors’ analyses and conclusions about plant thermal tolerance macrophysiology.

Ecophysiology is the study of the interrelationship between physiological processes the environment. Plant ecophysiology is a broad discipline, and my research interests currently focus on understanding how plants respond to and cope with variation in temperature. More specifically, I am interested in understanding how temperatures influence photosynthesis. 

Photosynthesis is an essential metabolic process for most plants, and is important for everything from predicting plant growth, survival, and reproduction to ecosystem services like carbon sequestration. Understanding the effects of temperature on photosynthesis is fundamental for understanding broader patterns in ecology and evolution including predicting how plants will respond to climate change.

title: "Main figs from 'Photosystem II heat tolerances characterize thermal generalists' publication "
---

## Overview
This script reproduces the main figures and analyses for the publication [Photosystem II heat tolerances characterize thermal generalists and the upper limit of carbon assimilation]({{< ref "/publication/PCE.2021/index.md" >}}). The analyses are straightforward and basically consistent of calculating phylogenetically-corrected Pearson's correlation coefficients to test hypotheses regarding the expected relationships between leaf carbon assimilation traits and photosynthetic heat tolerances. 


Here is a [link to GitHub repository](https://github.com/tmoreperez/PCE.figures) with the data used in the main text and the clade ages from [Gastauer & Meira-Neto 2017](https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0102-33062017000200191&script=sci_abstract). The code used to estimate the carbon assimilation parameters [can be found here]({{< ref "code/AT curve/index.md" >}}) and the code used to estimate photosynthetic heat tolerances [can be found here.]({{< ref "code/Heat tolerance/index.md" >}})
